# React Native frontend for FE Intel (Fuel Efficiency Intelligence).

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). It was updates to include storybooks using `npx storybook@latest init` as described in the [StorybookJS ReactNative documumentation](https://github.com/storybookjs/react-native). 

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    yarn start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

3. Notes

- for some reason stories did not work from the `components` folder, but needed to be put in `stories` folder inside of `.storybook`.
